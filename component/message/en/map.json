Once you have identified these areas, you can draw a boundary around them and obtain summary statistics on their estimated benefits, costs, and risks (i.e., constraints). This information can help you assess tradeoffs and set restoration priorities for regions of interest.",

Costs include both opportunity and implementation costs. This indicator allows you to compare the restoration suitability of different sites and determine which ones offer higher returns on investment."
